# Usage
<!-- usage -->
```sh-session
This plugin is used to ensure there are no violations of the deprecation policy when a new plugin/command has been added to the CLI. 

$ sfdx deprecation:generate - The plugin generates a goldfile that has a list of all the commands on OCLIF. 

$ sfdx deprecation: checkdiff - Once a new command is created it runs a quick comparison between the previous command list and the updated one to make sure there are no violations of the deprecation policy.
